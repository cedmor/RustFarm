         * - Make an overlay
         * - Determine what kind of display to have for the results of breeding
         * - Make the tests regarding the breeding plants/questions
         * - Change the breeding algorithm to take into account the random gene & probability
         *      - Number of compute have been raised to add the 1st plant, maybe it should be nice
         *          to investigate searching for the needed plants at the end (and engineer it if needed)
         *      - Do not return the best plant, store it untill the end of the generation and return
         *          the best plant possible and multiple results.
